# basecampcodingacademy.org

BCCA corporate website built with [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).

Source code is inside `/src`. Build output is in `/docs` (for the sake of
GitHub Pages).

Be sure to `npm install` the dependencies.

Run `npm start` to start watching `src` and building to `docs`.
This will also start an http server that serves the built output.
